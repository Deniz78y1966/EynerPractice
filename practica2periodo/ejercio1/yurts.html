            <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.<br>
                Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor,<br>
                and a roof dome that can be opened.

            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.<br>
                Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold<br>
                running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather<br>
                with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
